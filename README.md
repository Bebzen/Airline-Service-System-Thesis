# Airline-Service-System-Thesis
A System that supports an airline's service designed as a part of my engineering thesis. Made in .NET Core and Angular.
Since I started my first job I have learned a lot about making C# + Angular apps and I wanted to employ that knowledge here, in my thesis.
I also wanted to learn more while working on this project so as to aid me in my future endeavors.
The project is updated as I write my thesis.
Documentation is available only in Polish.

In order to run the app:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in VStudio.
3. Right click on AirlineServiceSoftware.Database and publish the database. This will create a database using all the scripts.
4. If the connection string needs to be adjusted, open appsettings.json and change it in line 3.
5. Build the solution.
6. In VCode run the 'npm install' command.
7. In VStudio change from IISExpress to AirlineServiceSoftware and click the green arrow.
8. In VCode run the 'npm start' command.
