# Airline-Service-System-Thesis
A System that supports an airline's service designed as a part of my engineering thesis. Made in .NET Core and Angular.
I have successfuly defended my engineering thesis - this is the app that i presented during my defense. The whole thesis is also included in the files - available only in Polish.

In order to run the app in debug:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in VStudio.
3. Right click on AirlineServiceSoftware.Database and publish the database. This will create a database using all the scripts.
4. If the connection string needs to be adjusted, open appsettings.json and change it in line 3.
5. Build the solution.
6. In VCode run the 'npm install' command.
7. In VStudio change from IISExpress to AirlineServiceSoftware and click the green arrow.
8. In VCode run the 'npm start' command.
